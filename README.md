# SampleRocketPlugin
Project template to easily set up a RocketMod4/LDM project.

# Requirements
* .NET Framework 4.8.1
* Visual Studio 2022
* Unturned 3 Dedicated Server installed using SteamCMD at C:\SteamCMD\steamapps\common\U3DS.
* Building or launching will create a server called `TestServer`.

# Features
* Global Usings
* Direct build to and launch your server inside of visual studio (no breakpoints unfortunately)
* Helper code for messing with players, barricades, structures, tasks, Harmony patching, and chat/translations.
* High performance translations with easy formatting using [] instead of <>.
* Convenient extension methods and helper classes.

# Usage
Feel free to use any of this code in your projects or fork it to adapt it to your use case.
If you plan to open source I'd appreciate leaving the link to this template at the top of the helper classes you use (it's already there in the template).
